## Why AI for Proteins?

Proteins are the molecular machines of life. Understanding their structure and function is central to biology and medicine. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have revolutionized our ability to predict and design proteins.

## The Protein Problem

A protein is a chain of amino acids that folds into a specific 3D structure. The **protein folding problem** — predicting a protein's structure from its amino acid sequence — was one of biology's grand challenges for over 50 years.

### Anfinsen's Dogma

In 1973, Christian Anfinsen demonstrated that a protein's amino acid sequence determines its 3D structure. This means that in principle, we should be able to predict structure from sequence:

$$\text{Sequence} \xrightarrow{f} \text{Structure}$$

## The AlphaFold Revolution

In 2020, DeepMind's AlphaFold2 achieved near-experimental accuracy in protein structure prediction, effectively solving the protein folding problem for single chains.

Key innovations included:
1. **Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs)** to capture evolutionary information
2. **Attention mechanisms** to model residue-residue interactions
3. **Equivariant neural networks** to respect the symmetries of 3D space
