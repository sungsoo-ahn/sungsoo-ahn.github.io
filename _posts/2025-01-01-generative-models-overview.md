## Introduction to Generative Models

Generative models are a class of machine learning models that learn to generate new data samples that resemble the training data. They model the underlying probability distribution of the data and can sample from it.

## Types of Generative Models

### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

VAEs learn a latent representation of the data by encoding inputs into a probabilistic latent space and decoding samples from this space back to the data space.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs consist of two networks—a generator and a discriminator—that are trained adversarially. The generator learns to produce realistic samples while the discriminator learns to distinguish real from generated samples.

### Diffusion Models

Diffusion models learn to reverse a gradual noising process. They have recently achieved state-of-the-art results in image generation and other domains.

## Applications

- **Image Generation**: Creating photorealistic images
- **Drug Discovery**: Generating novel molecular structures
- **Text Generation**: Language models for text synthesis
- **Audio Synthesis**: Music and speech generation
