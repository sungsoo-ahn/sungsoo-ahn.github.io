## What are Graph Neural Networks?

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models designed to perform inference on data structured as graphs. Unlike traditional neural networks that operate on fixed-size inputs like vectors or grids, GNNs can handle arbitrary graph structures with varying numbers of nodes and edges.

## Key Concepts

### Message Passing

The fundamental operation in most GNNs is message passing, where nodes exchange information with their neighbors. In each layer, a node aggregates messages from its neighbors and updates its representation accordingly.

### Node Embeddings

GNNs learn to compute node embeddings—low-dimensional vector representations that capture both the features of a node and its structural position in the graph.

## Applications

- **Social Network Analysis**: Predicting user behavior and community detection
- **Molecular Property Prediction**: Predicting chemical properties of molecules
- **Recommendation Systems**: Learning user and item representations
- **Traffic Prediction**: Modeling road networks for traffic forecasting
