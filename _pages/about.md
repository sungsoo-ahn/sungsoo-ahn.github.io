I am an Assistant Professor at [KAIST Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/), where I direct the **Structured and Probabilistic Machine Learning (SPML) Lab**.

My research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for molecules, with applications to drug discovery and material design. I enjoy bringing a machine learning perspective—especially a probabilistic one—to scientific problems, and diving deep into the underlying physics, chemistry, and biology.
