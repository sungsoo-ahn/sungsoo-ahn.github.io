I am an Assistant Professor at [KAIST Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/), where I direct the **Structured and Probabilistic Machine Learning (SPML) Lab**.

My research focuses on **developing machine learning algorithms for molecules**, with applications to drug discovery and material design. Our work spans generative models, flow matching, diffusion models, graph neural networks, and language models applied to chemistry and molecular science.

**Research Interests:**
- Molecular generation and design
- Generative models (diffusion, flow matching)
- Graph neural networks
- Large language models for chemistry
- Drug discovery and material science

If you are interested in joining the SPML Lab as a graduate student, postdoc, or research intern, please feel free to reach out via email.
