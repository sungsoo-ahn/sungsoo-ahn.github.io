  description: >-
    This course explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and protein science.
    The AI section covers modern deep learning approaches — from foundational concepts
    to state-of-the-art models including AlphaFold, RFDiffusion, and ProteinMPNN.
    All lecture notes are written in a textbook narrative style, accessible to students
    new to machine learning.
  prerequisites: >-
    Python programming, linear algebra, basic probability.
    No prior deep learning experience required.
  assessment: "Midterm project (50%), Final project (50%)"
